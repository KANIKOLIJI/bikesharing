# bikesharing
Tableau Work!


## The purpose of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if it worth to have a bikesharing company in NewYork city. We tried to analize different aspects and see the number of customers that use bikes for commuting, their gender, hotspots in the city, the duration of trips, best time to repair bikes, and we narrow down the analysis to see what is the chance by gender by weekday per hour. We would like to represent the data in a way that can be understood and impressive, so we would use the tableau for visualizing our data.


## Results:


* The number of subscribers are much more than customers, and that means there are more people who regularly use bikes to commute.

* we could see trips by weekday per hour in this graph that shows that 8 am and 5 pm during the week are the best time for business so may have more employees available to make the process faster.

## Summary:

As per visualizations we can see that the hotspots are spred all over the city, and the number of subscribers show the demand for bike. New york is a busy city and there is the lack of parking spot, so bike sharing could be very cheaper and more convinient. If we could get the data for the number of locations that we need to have to support the business and organize bikes as fast as possible, that could be so helpful. We need also know that how and when we suppose to plan the bike maintanance to avoid the waiting time for people who are in the rush to get to work or school.
