Tableau Work!


## The purpose of the analysis is well defined. (5 pt)

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if it worth to have a bikesharing company in NewYork city. We tried to analize different aspects and see the number of customers that use bikes for commuting, their gender, hotspots in the city, the duration of trips, best time to repair bikes, and we narrow down the analysis to see what is the chance by gender by weekday per hour. We would like to represent the data in a way that can be understood and impressive, so we would use the tableau for visualizing our data.
